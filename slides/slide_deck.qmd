# Quarto for collaborative research

## why geek out on Quarto?

- [This is why!](https://quinnasena.github.io/resbaz2022/template_complete.html)

- [and this](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/)

- [But is it taking over?](https://yihui.org/en/2022/04/quarto-r-markdown/)

## why I like Quarto

- [Well documented](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)

- Uses [markdown syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)

- Accepts multiple programming languages

- Outputs multiple formats (Word, PDF HTML...)

- Easy to learn and transfer skills from other languages


## another thing to learn?
::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}
- R Markdown and Jupyter also support multiple languages too...

- You decide ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ

## why collaborate via Quarto and Git?

- Version control your projects

- Reproducibility: whole workflow from data to results in one place

- Host a live link consistent with current results (no more copy paste 7 plots into a word doc each time you change something!)

- Coding colaborators can contribute via a Git workflow

- Communicate results to non-coding collaborators

# Buckle up, ready your coding fingers!

## today's goals

- Learn the necessary components of a Quarto document for HTML

- Publish an example link on GitHub

- Have a working template you can use in the future

- Know where to find help and useful resources

## Zoom

- Camera optional, but we love to see you (really, it helps me a lot!)

- During exercises, give me a :heavy_check_mark: when you are done or a :hand: if you need help

- Drop questions in the Zoom chat or raise a hand at any time

- We support inclusivity and a positive environment through the Code of Conduct

## first things first

- Open up VS Code and navigate to the source control
  - Clone the repo: https://github.com/QuinnAsena/resbaz2022.git

- Publish repo to your own GitHub account

- Open up the template.qmd file

:::{.callout-note}
We are using VS Code, R, and GitHub. If you have a preferred workflow like RStudio, Python, or GitKraken you can use them but may be harder to follow the session content. Afterall, Quarto is supposed to be flexible!

## elements of a Quarto file

:::{.incremental}
- YAML

- Text

- Code blocks

- References file

- scss (optional for style; won't cover this!)
:::

## YAML

Your Turn :computer: :

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
The YAML is a set of `key: value pairs` that are the metadata for your document, such as, author, title, output format, and citation file.

- YAML is whitespace sensitive

- Indent sensitive
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
``` yaml
---
title: "My Manuscript"
format: html
date: today
---
```
:::
::::

## YAML exercise

:::{.callout-tip}
# YAML exersice
- Open up the template.qmd and fill the `title: ` and `name: ` and `affiliation: ` fieds.

  - A couple of handy entries are already completed

  - The existing field: `date: today` will automatically generate today's date (cool huh?  ͡▀̿ ̿ ͜ʖ ͡▀̿ ̿ )

- Add a table of contents following the [guide](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html)

- Render the document

- Give me a :heavy_check_mark: when done or a :hand: if you need help
:::

## text editing

- Writing in Quarto uses [markdown syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) 

- LaTeX is used to render PDFs so LaTeX commands can be used for PDF outputs

- Look! I can do fancy maths: $f_{c}=z^{2}+c$
  - ▀̿ ̿ ͜ʖ ͡▀̿ ̿ 

:::{.callout-note}
# Pro tip!
Render regularly. Small errors can be tricky to pick out long after they have been made.

## including a bibliography

Citations require:

- a `.bib` or `.bibtex` file in your working directory (one is included for today)

  - The references file can be generated (and automatically sync) with Zotero and other reference managers.

- a YAML entry pointing to the file `bibliography: refs.bib` (if the file is named 'refs.bib')

- an optional `CSL` file specifying the format of the bibliography.

  - Useful for authoring articles as `CSL` files are [downloadable for specific journals](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles)

## in-text citations

Citing work in-text [follows the `@citekey` format](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html#inserting-citations)

- `@perkel2022` = @perkel2022

- `[@chamberlin1897; @perkel2022]` = [@chamberlin1897; @perkel2022]

- Quarto, by default, inserts a formatted reference list at the end of the document so I put an empty 'References' header.

We won't go deeper into citations for now as we are not authoring an article today. The link above has info for technical writing.

## equations

Pretty, formatted equations can be inserted using the same syntax as in LaTeX. Inline equations (e.g., $E = mc^2$) are surrounded by a `$` and equation bocks are surrounded by `$$`:

$$
N_{t+1} = N_t + r_{d}N_t \left(1- \frac{N_t}{K} \right)
$$

## handy features

The RStudio IDE has some handy features using the visual editor:

- [Visual R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/)

- [Content editing](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/content.html)

- [Technical writing](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.htm)

VS Code also has cool features:

- [Like YAML intelligence](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html#yaml-intelligence)

## markdown exercise

:::{.callout-tip}
# Markdown exercise

- Check out [Quarto's markdown guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)

- and the [biostats guide to writing](https://biostats-r.github.io/biostats/quarto/04-figures-tables.html#equations)

In the template Introduction section take 3-4 minutes to write:

- a sub-heading under the introduction

- a list

- and an equation

- cite one of the articles in in existing `.bib` file using the `@`

- render the document and hit the :heavy_check_mark: in zoom
:::


## code blocks

Code is executed when the document is rendered. Code blocks can also be executed individually just like regular R markdown if you are already familiar with that. Code blocks are inserted like this:
```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: false
6*7
```

Code block options are set with a special comment: `#| ` (white space sensitive!). [Block options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html) determine how the code is executed, e.g., whether to display the code block: `#| echo: true`, warning messages `#| warning: false`, and to input captions `#| fig-cap: "A really good figure caption!"`.

:::{.callout-note}
# Pro tip!
Unlike R markdown, block options are lower case true/false and the comment `#| ` must be followed by a space.
:::

## inline code

Code can also be executed inline:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
cat("``` markdown\n")
cat("Seven times six is `r 7 * 6`")
cat("\n```")
```

Inline code execution can be helpful referencing values in text like: there are `nrow(data)` observations in the data.

## code exercise

:::{.callout-tip}
# Code block exercise

- Check out the [Block options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html) and edit the existing code block options in the 'Libraries section' to:

 - display the results

 - exclude the code

 - include a figure caption

 - render the document and hit the :heavy_check_mark: in zoom

## tabsets {.scrollable}

Ok now the feature I find *very* useful: tabsets. Tabsets are great for showing, multiple results, data, code, whatever you want in tabs.

::: panel-tabset
# Code
```{r tabsetPlot}
#| echo: true

library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
# From: https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/examples.html
mass_flipper <- ggplot(data = penguins,
                       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                           y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species,
                 shape = species),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.7),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
)
```

# Data
```{r}
rmarkdown::paged_table(penguins[1:50,])
```

# Plot
```{r}
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: Flipper length and body mass for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins
#| fig-alt: Plot of penguin bill length against body mass by species

mass_flipper
```

## Tabset code

Tabsets are created by:

```quarto
::: panel-tabset
# Tab 1
content

# Tab 2
content
:::

```

## Let'g go Git it

You're now ready to host your first live link!

:::{.callout-tip}
# GitHub

- Render your project so that most recent changes are included in the HTML

- In the source control on the left commit and push your changes
 
  - You can do this however you prefer, commandline, GUI, source control...

- Head over to GitHub in your browser and go:

  - Settings -> GitHub pages -> enable github pages

- By default, your link will be hosted at: https://githubusername.github.io/reponame/pathtodocument.html
