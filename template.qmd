# Introduction

A quarto document generated during a Resbaz tutorial. 

Wow, A list:

- item one
- item two 
- item three
- item four

A equation:

$$\mathrm{CO_3^{2-} + H^+ \rightleftharpoons HCO_3^{2-}}$$

A citation (@perkel2022).

# Libraries {.unnumbered .unlisted}

Generally it is good practice to include a list of packages you use up front. But you may not need to show them in the output or list them in the table of contents. The `{.unnumbered .unlisted}` commands following the heading remove this section from the table of contents but it will remain in the text. Quarto accepts multiple coding languages, the following example uses R. I have set up working R code chunks so that for this tutorial you do not need to be familiar with R. Here, we will experiment with a few code [execution options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html).


If you want to use Python code check out the documentation [here](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html#overview).


:::{.callout-tip}
# Code block exercise

- Check out the [Block options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html) and edit (and add to) the existing code block options below to:

 - exclude the results, messages and warnings

 - exclude the code from the HTML output (make sure it still evaluates!)

 - render the document and hit the :heavy_check_mark: in zoom

```{r Libraries}
#| include: true

if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman", repos="http://cran.r-project.org")
pacman::p_load(ggplot2, palmerpenguins)    # Install & load packages
```

```{python python.reticulate = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
print("test")
```

# Tabsets

:::{.callout-tip}
# Tabset exercise

- Check out the [tabset panel documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/layout.html#tabset-panel)

- Create a tabset with three tabs in the template under the Tabsets heading

  - Does not matter what they contain but feel free to blurb something in there

- render the document and hit the :heavy_check_mark: in zoom
:::

# Images

:::{.callout-tip}
# Images exercise

- There is a (royalty free) XKCD comic inside the images directory in the repo. [Check out the guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html), and insert the image into one of the tabsets you just created.

# let'g go Git it

You're now ready to host your first live link!

:::{.callout-tip}
# GitHub

- Render your project so that most recent changes are exported

- In the source control on the left commit and push your changes
 
  - You can do this however you prefer, commandline, GUI, source control...

- Head over to GitHub in your browser and go:

  - Settings -> GitHub pages -> enable github pages

- By default, your link will be hosted at: https://githubusername.github.io/reponame/pathtodocument.html

  - The repo can remain private but anyone who has the link can view it.

- Find your hosted template link and share with the world!

# References

References are generated by default so include a final empty heading (delete this text) called References or Bibliography, or whatever is appropriate.
